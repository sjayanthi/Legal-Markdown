# Legal Markdown

The idea of this project is to extend the standard Markdown to support things relevant for legal writing. A lot of this will be related to legal citations. But as you know, legal citation writing is tied to legal research and exhibit citations, where lawyers spend a lot of time on.  

The goal is to support "lazy" writing, in which we dump all the ideas in the paper and are not really concerned about being consistent.  A markdown supporting this should treat latin citation characters as special entities lazily.  It should also be able to support parsing of citation clauses because those have different semantical content and syntatical requirements from normal English sentences.  Should also support footnotes.  And principally, it should support (1) comments, (2) revisions, and (3) hypertexting with other documents.
